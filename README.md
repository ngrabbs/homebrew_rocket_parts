# Fun with home made rockets 

The goal of this project is learn about rocketry, have some fun with my kids and give me another avenue to work on hardware specific software.

## homebrew v0.2/3/4/5

### v0.5 -> big scary 
### v0.4 -> cato-lac
### v0.3 -> no name
This rocket is of the same design as v0.2 no changes I believe.  We started printing "rod rings", little rings you could slide over the body tube to attach the rocket to the launch rod.  This saved us from having to buy cardboard launch lugs.  Around this time we got a bad batch of E motors and had several cato's with 2 & 3.  At this time we started designing and printing our own nose cones as well as our own electronics bays to hold an eggtimer.

### v0.2 -> lawn dart express
This rocket is still a hybrid but had a screw on fin can.  It had a small boss that you could glue into the back of a body tube then screw the fin can into. You could test different fin designs or motor combinations without changing the main part of the body.  We flew it several times mostly on E motors till eventually we knocked the fins off it.

## homebrew v0.1
home brew v0.1 is what I call a "hybrid."  Its part model, cardboard tube, probably a factory estes nose cone.  The only thing that was 3d printed was the fin can.  You'd print the fin can, then glue it into a peice of estes body tube.  This fin can takes 3 A motors.  We under powered it when we launched it and it was distasterous.  We only tried to launch it once before moving on.  You can find a lot of .stl files here in homebrew_v0.1, I dont remember exactly which combination we printed and flew but it gave me a lot of experience with drawing things in solid works.

# Origin
The first rocket that we flew was a prebuilt Estes Rip Tide kit that my wife got us for Christmas at the end of 2020.  We flew it a bunch and then flew some smaller Swift models, then a Cherokee E.  Sometime after that we started drawing up parts in cad and printing them.  It took awhile before we launched home printed parts.
